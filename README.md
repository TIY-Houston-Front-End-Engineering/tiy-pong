Hi frontend!

Help me make this site less ugly by forking this!

* Add styles to app/stylesheets/styles.scss

* Add html to any of the html files in app/views/players

* Bootstrap is included

* The <% .. %> is just ruby code, you can wrap them in html tags to style ie

```
<div class="awesome">
 <%= rubycode %>
</div>
```
* You can add add classes to any of the link_to or ***_tag by adding ", class: "classname" ie

```
<%= link_to "new", path %>
<%= link_to "new", path, class: "awesome" %>
```
